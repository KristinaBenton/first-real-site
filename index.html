    <h1>Family Travels</h1>
    <p> This is my first draft of my very first website, and I am choosing to go with traveling as my starter theme! 
        My fiance, David, and I love traveling. We've vacationed twice in Colorado and once on a beach in South Carolina 
        after a very interesting 18hr road trip.</p>

    <p> We also go on countless camping/hiking trips with our dog, Scout.</p>
